#console app which you can schedule on your local machine.
-------------

I've scheduled it to run everyday at 2 pm on my local machine. I was doing it every 10 minutes and camel website blocked my calls.

I used this console app during the pandemic to know if a product is available on a given day.

Please update the product.json with camel product path and also update the smtp server setting in appsettings.json
